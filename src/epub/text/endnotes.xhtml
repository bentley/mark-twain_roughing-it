				<p>“Bunch-grass” grows on the bleak mountainsides of Nevada and neighboring territories, and offers excellent feed for stock, even in the dead of winter, wherever the snow is blown aside and exposes it; notwithstanding its unpromising home, bunch-grass is a better and more nutritious diet for cattle and horses than almost any other hay or grass that is known⁠—so stockmen say. <a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<p>And what makes that worn anecdote the more aggravating, is, that the adventure it celebrates <em>never occurred</em>. If it were a good anecdote, that seeming demerit would be its chiefest virtue, for creative power belongs to greatness; but what ought to be done to a man who would wantonly contrive so flat a one as this? If <em>I</em> were to suggest what ought to be done to him, I should be called extravagant⁠—but what does the sixteenth chapter of Daniel say? Aha! <a href="chapter-20.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<p>However, one prophecy was verified, at any rate. It was asserted by the desperadoes that one of their brethren (Joe McGee, <em>a special policeman</em>) was known to be the conspirator chosen by lot to assassinate Williams; and they also asserted that doom had been pronounced against McGee, and that he would be assassinated in exactly the same manner that had been adopted for the destruction of Williams⁠—a prophecy which came true a year later. After twelve months of distress (for McGee saw a fancied assassin in every man that approached him), he made the last of many efforts to get out of the country unwatched. He went to Carson and sat down in a saloon to wait for the stage⁠—it would leave at four in the morning. But as the night waned and the crowd thinned, he grew uneasy, and told the barkeeper that assassins were on his track. The barkeeper told him to stay in the middle of the room, then, and not go near the door, or the window by the stove. But a fatal fascination seduced him to the neighborhood of the stove every now and then, and repeatedly the bar-keeper brought him back to the middle of the room and warned him to remain there. But he could not. At three in the morning he again returned to the stove and sat down by a stranger. Before the barkeeper could get to him with another warning whisper, someone outside fired through the window and riddled McGee’s breast with slugs, killing him almost instantly. By the same discharge the stranger at McGee’s side also received attentions which proved fatal in the course of two or three days. <a href="chapter-49.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
